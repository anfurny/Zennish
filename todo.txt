////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// @todo -- belowDogfood it-- Every now and then the intro screen shows up again, have run into bug this way. Investigate-- These are related -- Flashes a lot at startup. Can I put default visibility states? Is this just an angular thing?- Add an note on failure. But only on first time?// On completion it shows stats, (maybe allows leaderboard), maybe allows a share link,  and perhaps auto-quits.// Recenter pause screen// So this note system does nothing.////////////////////////////V2 -VISION:- Noteboxes respond to EVENTS so the first time you fail, a note comes up.- Expand the personality thing. Add an image of this persona?- animation on correct or wrong, and every attempted action////////////////////////////// @maybe do later if I am feeling OCD// move rekey into fancy// make transition between steps better. Just unmasking question marks does not indicate a transition sufficiently.// Have system Run all previous tests to make sure code doesn't break on refactor.// Flow: Refreshing the page shouldn't destroy state.// Preserve all state. Nothing should be lost on a refresh.// Let's list all inherent "State"...// -- View state (dialogs up [intro, load], collapses,)// -- All open tabs, and their current values// -- Auto-save on navigate-away by using a handler!// need to make the dev-console the default output window.// ?? Scores don't immediately show up due to race condition... force refresh on changing angular variable or use function?   Then force refresh on completion of challenge?// If there are any scores hide "Recommended challenge"// Resizing needs to allow more than two sizes// however, now I can open multiple copies of the same save... Is that really bad, what if I alter a save, don't change it, and want to load the original?// Also I feel like (save) names should be unique. This difference from an operating system is confusing.////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// @ not highest priority// only pause if a challenge is running... otherwise it's confusing.//ability to chose comparison function? Or something?// need to put mapToReduce and mapToMap in fancy for now// need to be able to resize frames better// all this needs to be namespaced & wrapped so user javascript can't mess with it.// I seem to have made some progress here...//   -- dom manipulation ?//          document.write ...//   -- They can still manipulate dom Via $ ... which I guess is okay?

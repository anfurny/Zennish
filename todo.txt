////////////////////////////// @maybe do later if I am feeling OCD// Have system Run all previous tests to make sure code doesn't break on refactor.// Flow: Refreshing the page shouldn't destroy state.// Preserve all state. Nothing should be lost on a refresh.// Let's list all inherent "State"...// -- View state (dialogs up [intro, load], collapses,)// -- All open tabs, and their current values// -- Auto-save on navigate-away by using a handler!// need to make the dev-console the default output window.// ?? Scores don't immediately show up due to race condition... force refresh on changing angular variable or use function?   Then force refresh on completion of challenge?// If there are any scores hide "Recommended challenge"// Resizing needs to allow more than two sizes// however, now I can open multiple copies of the same save... Is that really bad, what if I alter a save, don't change it, and want to load the original?// Also I feel like (save) names should be unique. This difference from an operating system is confusing.////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// @todo -- belowDEBUGGING IS A PAIN IN MY ASS - If I run a test with debug by itself I'd like debugger to come up... or some way to do that.-- Okay, debugging sucks. How do you want to do it? Let's run a series and see.-- Okay, after running an example, here's what I want:- I want to be able to put the word "Debugger" in my code and run a particular test and have it break there and ONLY there.// need a way to view scoring on a particular challengeFlashes a lot at startup. Can I put default visibility states? Is this just an angular thing?I need a basic tutorial. It's not clear you can throw debugger into the window for example.This should be of the form of a "educational" test. Should basically include:-- I need an overlay to point out where stuff is.-- Then should show helpful popup boxes-- Explain tests-- explain debug-- Explain bringing up the console-- Explain auto-pausing and such-- Explain scoringCSS:I can't make tests if the window isn't wide enough... I need to make a window scrollbar if the window go below my "Min size"Even if the window is full width sometimes tests fail// dogfood it// Note for:// -- Not chrome// -- Console not open// need a collapse for bottom?// needs to work better on laptop, code window too tall// animation on correct or wrong, and every attempted action// On completion it shows stats, (maybe allows leaderboard), maybe allows a share link,  and perhaps auto-quits.// explain the ability to debug tests(Put a help Icon by each piece)// make overlay// make transition between steps better. Just unmasking question marks does not indicate a transition sufficiently.Tests need to be more readablemove rekey into fancy// Recenter pause screen// So this note system does nothing.////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// @ not highest priority// only pause if a challenge is running... otherwise it's confusing.//ability to chose comparison function?

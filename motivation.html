<h1>What is this?</h1>

        It's my little demo of a new type of programming challenge.


<h1>Why?</h1>

<h2>As a Teaching Tool</h2>
There's a constant battle in programming between generalizing for potential what-ifs, and writing simple clear code that gets shit done. And there's a lot of disagreement. Ultimately I find that you have to use judgment and take these in a case-by-case basis. But it's nice to practice in a low-stakes environment.

Technical debt is an insidious danger because it's so invisible. It can be a very slow lesson when you don't see the consequences of bad code for months or longer, or not learned at all if it's somebody else suffering from your inflexible code. By shortening the cycle, the consequences of coding choices can be seen immediately.

<h2>As a programming test</h2>

The predominant kind of programming test:
Quickly writing scalable algorithms to very complicated mathy computation problems (e.g. google code competition, codility, dropbox interview question)


I don't mind these types of challenges, but it's a mistake to consider them a significant perdictor of being a good contributor to a programming project.
 Most software projects are prone to change those tests have a clearly defined problem that will not change.
 Most software projects don't actually require an awareness of very mathy things (don't get me wrong, I love mathy things, but if I said I've used it more that 1% of the time at any of my engineering jobs I'd be lying).
 Most code good code is not about performance optimization; frequently such optimization is a negative that detracts from reusability
 Most coding is about solving a series of small hurdles by quickly making smart choices to small problems; those tests are all-or-nothing.

<h1>Who are you?</h1>
        I'm <a href='http://www.alexrohde.com'>Alex.</a>

<h1>I love you, your code, your sense of humor, the extent to which you think about this kind of thing, or something... Can I hire you for an amazing position?</h1>
        I'm happily employed right now. However, if you are not a recruiter and have a uniquely attractive offer you can reach out, I may be able to connect you to somebody who fits the position.
